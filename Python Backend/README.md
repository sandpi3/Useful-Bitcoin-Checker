# Python Backend
This is where the data is gathered and exported to FireBase.

    We use the btc-stock.py file as our script.

This script runs on a Google Cloud Compute VM and the program loops every 60 minutes.
        
```python
    while True:
      run_function()
      print("SOMETHING_TO_SPECIFY_COMPLETION")
      time.sleep(3600)
```
